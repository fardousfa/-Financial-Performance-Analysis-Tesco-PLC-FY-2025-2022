# Financial-Performance-Analysis-Tesco-PLC-FY-2025-2022

## Project Description

<p align="justify">This project showcases a 4-year financial performance analysis of Tesco Plc using data-driven techniques in Excel and Power Query. I extracted and cleaned Tesco’s annual reports using power Query Editor and Excel to calculate and visualize key financial ratios across profitability, liquidity, efficiency, and solvency. Where applicable, I have benchmarked Tesco’s ratios against Sainsbury’s to provide industry-level context.</p>

## Project Objectives

- Perform vertical analysis on Tesco’s Income Statement and Balance Sheet.

- Calculate and interpret key financial ratios across four areas: Profitability, Liquidity, Solvency, Efficiency
      
- Identify trends, strengths, weaknesses, and areas of concern over the Four-year period.

- Benchmark select metrics against competitor Sainsbury’s to assess competitive positioning.



## Key Insights

- Profitability rebounded, with ROE and ROA now outpacing Sainsbury’s.

- Operational efficiency strengthened, led by faster inventory and receivables turnover.

- Liquidity tightened, with current and quick ratios below 1.0.

- Working capital cycle stayed efficient, maintaining a negative CCC.

- Leverage reduced, but Tesco remains more geared than Sainsbury’s.

- Interest coverage improved, showing stronger debt servicing ability.



## Process Overview

**Data Source:** Tesco Plc annual reports (2022–2025) in PDF format.

**Tools Used:**

- Power Query to import and clean raw financial statements.
- Excel formulas for ratio calculation and vertical analysis.
- Charting and formatting to visualise trends across key ratios.

**Benchmarking:** Key metrics were compared with competitor Sainsbury’s Plc to contextualise Tesco’s performance.

## Financial Ratio Commentary

### Strong Recovery in Profitability

<img width="1020" height="440" alt="Prof" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c7072a0-d32a-4e55-af30-5cca9a9be072" />

<p align="justify"> Tesco has demonstrated a solid rebound in profitability over the past three years, underscored by significant improvements across all key returns metrics. Return on Equity (ROE) more than doubled from 6.02% in FY23 to 13.98% in FY25, outperforming Sainsbury’s 9.94% and highlighting stronger shareholder value creation. Similarly, Return on Assets (ROA) rose from 2.17% to 4.45%, again ahead of Sainsbury’s 2.19%, indicating greater efficiency in turning assets into profits. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) surged to 6.97%, up from 3.07%, and well above Sainsbury’s 3.18%, reflecting enhanced capital productivity.

Margin performance was stable, with Tesco’s gross profit margin holding at 5.9%, on par with Sainsbury’s 5.62%, suggesting both maintain a competitive pricing-cost balance. Operating margin improved to 3.88%, slightly ahead of Sainsbury’s 3.28%, pointing to better cost control and operational scalability.</p>

### Improved Capital Efficiency & Working Capital Cycle Remains Efficient

<p align="justify"> Tesco’s asset utilisation continues to improve, reflecting tighter operational control and sales execution. Asset turnover rose to 1.80 in FY25, outpacing Sainsbury’s 1.32, suggesting Tesco is generating more revenue per pound of assets. Receivables turnover reached 62.78, far stronger than Sainsbury’s 49.91, indicating superior credit management. Inventory turnover improved to 18.77, compared to Sainsbury’s 13.15 — a key competitive advantage in fast-moving retail.

Although payables turnover dipped slightly to 53.07, versus Sainsbury’s 61.89, Tesco is still effectively managing supplier terms, keeping working capital healthy.

Tesco maintains a highly efficient working capital cycle, a hallmark of retail success. Its cash conversion cycle (CCC) remained negative at –18.9 days, closely aligned with Sainsbury’s –21.05. This negative CCC reflects strong inventory movement, fast receivables collection, and favourable payables terms — essential for maintaining liquidity despite thin margins.</p>

### Liquidity Pressures Remain

<img width="1029" height="262" alt="Liq" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d0c19cc-be12-4723-91a7-ca459e0be461" />

<p align="justify">Despite profitability improvements, Tesco faces ongoing liquidity constraints. Its current ratio fell from 0.75 in FY23 to 0.64 in FY25, below the industry ideal of 1.0, and just under Sainsbury’s 0.76. The quick ratio declined to 0.44, versus Sainsbury’s 0.57, reflecting Tesco’s continued reliance on inventory to meet short-term obligations. While not unusual in retail, this signals limited cash flexibility in the short run.</p>

### Leverage Stabilising Amid Risk Control

<img width="1023" height="450" alt="Lev" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faffe6f3-8559-475e-b8be-4a0a1dc0574e" />

<p align="justify">Tesco is steadily reducing its financial leverage. The debt-to-equity ratio dropped from 3.03 to 2.33 in FY25, though it remains higher than Sainsbury’s 1.21, signalling a more leveraged but improving capital structure. Capital gearing fell from 66.22% to 53.19%, suggesting greater funding through equity rather than debt. Importantly, Tesco’s interest coverage ratio increased to 3.63, compared to Sainsbury’s 2.35, indicating stronger earnings capacity to meet financing costs and a healthier debt risk profile.</p>


## Vertical Analysis (P&L and Balance Sheet)

**Cost of Sales:**

-  ~91% of revenue — major expense, so any savings here have large impact.

- Minor increases year-over-year signal inflationary pressure.

**Admin & Operating Expenses:**

- Steadily increasing as a % of revenue, impacting profitability.

 **Balance Sheet:**

- Inventory and payables dominate current assets/liabilities.

- Tesco shows leaner structure than Sainsbury, but higher debt load.
